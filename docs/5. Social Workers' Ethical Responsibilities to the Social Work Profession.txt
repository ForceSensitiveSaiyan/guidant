5. Responsibilities to the Profession (Simplified)
5.01 Keeping the Profession Strong and Honest
(a) Social workers should aim for high standards in how they practice.

(b) They should stick to and promote the core values, ethics, knowledge, and mission of social work. They can help the profession grow by studying, doing research, and having open and honest conversations—even critical ones—about how to improve it.

(c) Social workers should volunteer their time and skills to help the profession be seen as valuable, ethical, and skilled. This could include teaching, giving talks, doing research, or getting involved in social work organizations.

(d) They should share what they know—about practice, research, and ethics—with others in the field, whether through writing articles or speaking at conferences.

(e) They should also help prevent people from doing social work without the right qualifications or approval.

5.02 Evaluation and Research (Keeping It Real and Ethical)
(a) Social workers should regularly check how well programs and services are working.

(b) They should support and take part in research that helps grow social work knowledge.

(c) They should stay updated with the latest research and use it in their daily work.

(d) If they do research or evaluations, they must think carefully about the impact and follow rules that protect the people involved. If needed, they should get approval from an ethics review board.

(e) Before involving people in research, social workers should get clear, written consent from them. People must understand what the research is about and that they can say no without being punished.

(f) If technology is involved in research, the social worker must make sure the participant understands how it’s used and offer alternatives if they’re uncomfortable using it.

(g) If someone can't give informed consent (like a child or someone with a disability), the social worker must explain what’s going on, get their agreement if possible, and get written consent from a responsible adult.

(h) Some research might not involve direct consent (like watching people in public or using old data). This is only okay if an ethics board says it’s justified and there’s no other way to do it.

(i) Participants can leave the research at any time and shouldn’t be penalized for doing so.

(j) Social workers should make sure people in the study can get support if needed.

(k) They must protect participants from physical or emotional harm.

(l) Any info gathered should only be discussed for professional reasons, and only with those who need to know.

(m) Confidentiality is key—social workers should explain how they’ll keep people’s data private and what the limits of confidentiality are.

(n) Personal info should only be shared if the person gives written permission.

(o) Research findings must be reported honestly—no making things up or hiding mistakes.

(p) Social workers must avoid conflicts of interest with participants, and if one arises, they must act in the participant's best interest.

(q) They should also teach students and colleagues how to do research responsibly.
