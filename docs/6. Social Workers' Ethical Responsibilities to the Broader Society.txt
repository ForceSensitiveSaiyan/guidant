6. Responsibility to Society (Simplified)
6.01 Supporting the Well-Being of Everyone
Social workers should work to improve society as a whole—locally, nationally, and globally. This means helping people and communities grow in a healthy way and supporting fair conditions so everyone’s basic needs are met. Social workers should stand up for social justice and promote values that treat all people fairly.

6.02 Helping the Public Get Involved
Social workers should help people understand and get involved in shaping social policies and systems that affect their lives. An informed public is a powerful tool for change.

6.03 Stepping Up in Emergencies
In times of crisis—like natural disasters or other emergencies—social workers should help out however they can, using their professional skills to support those in need.

6.04 Taking Action for Justice

(a) Social workers should work for fair access to jobs, services, and opportunities for everyone. They should understand how politics affects people’s lives and speak up to change unfair laws and policies.

(b) They should focus especially on helping people who are vulnerable, marginalised, or treated unfairly, making sure these groups have more choices and opportunities.

(c) Social workers should promote respect for cultural and social differences, both in the U.S. and around the world. They should support programs and laws that respect diversity and make sure everyone is treated with dignity and fairness.

(d) Social workers should actively fight against racism, discrimination, and exploitation of any kind—whether based on race, gender, sexuality, disability, religion, immigration status, or any other factor.
