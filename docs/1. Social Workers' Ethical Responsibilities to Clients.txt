1. Responsibilities to Clients (Simplified)
1.01 Putting Clients First
Social workers are here to help clients and should usually prioritise their needs. But sometimes, legal duties (like reporting harm or abuse) may come before client wishes.

1.02 Supporting Client Choices
Clients should be helped to make their own decisions. If a client’s choices could cause serious harm, the social worker might need to step in.

1.03 Informed Consent
Clients need to clearly understand what services they're receiving, any risks, costs, limits, and how tech might be used.
If a client can’t fully understand, the social worker should explain things in a way they can, or involve someone who can help—like a legal guardian or interpreter.

1.04 Being Qualified
Social workers should only do work they're trained or experienced to do. If they’re learning new techniques, they must get proper training or supervision. They also need to understand how to use technology in a professional way.

1.05 Cultural Awareness
Social workers should understand and respect cultural differences and fight discrimination. They must reflect on their own biases and stay committed to learning.

1.06 Avoiding Conflicts of Interest
Social workers should be careful not to let personal interests get in the way of doing what’s best for the client. They should avoid mixing personal and professional relationships.

1.07 Respecting Privacy
Clients have a right to keep their information private. Social workers should only share what’s necessary and only when legally required or when someone is in danger.

1.08 Access to Client Records
Clients can ask to see their records. If that might be harmful or confusing, the social worker should explain the contents or only share part of the record, and explain why.

1.09 No Sexual Relationships
Social workers must not have any kind of sexual relationship with current or past clients or close people connected to them.

1.10 Physical Contact
If any physical contact (like a hug) could make the client uncomfortable or cause confusion, it should be avoided. If appropriate, boundaries must be clear and respectful.

1.11 No Sexual Harassment
Social workers must never harass clients in any way, including making unwanted sexual comments or advances.

1.12 Using Respectful Language
All communication—spoken, written, or online—must be respectful and free of insulting or harmful language.

1.13 Fair Payment
Fees should be reasonable and based on the service provided. Avoid taking goods or services as payment unless it’s a common practice, done respectfully, and with consent.

1.14 Clients Who Can’t Decide for Themselves
Social workers should take steps to protect the rights and needs of clients who can’t make their own decisions.

1.15 Service Interruptions
If services get interrupted (due to illness, tech issues, moving, or death), social workers should try to ensure the client isn’t left without help.

1.16 Referring Clients
If a client needs help the social worker can’t provide, they should refer them to someone else who can. This must be done properly, with all needed info shared (with permission).

1.17 Ending Services
Social workers should stop working with clients when help is no longer needed. They must not suddenly disappear unless necessary and should help the client transition to other services when needed.
