Preamble
The mission of social work is to enhance human well-being, especially for people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty. Social work focuses on both individual well-being and broader societal well-being, with attention to environmental forces that affect people’s lives.

Social workers promote social justice and change with and on behalf of clients, which includes individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. They work to end discrimination and social injustice in many forms. This can involve direct practice, organizing, consultation, advocacy, policy work, education, and research. Social workers help people address their own needs and also help institutions become more responsive.

The mission of the profession is rooted in these core values:

Service

Social justice

Dignity and worth of the person

Importance of human relationships

Integrity

Competence

These values shape the unique purpose and perspective of social work.

Purpose of the NASW Code of Ethics
Ethics are central to social work. The Code of Ethics sets out values, principles, and standards for conduct. It applies to all social workers, regardless of role or setting.

The Code serves six purposes:

Identifies core values of the profession.

Summarizes broad ethical principles and sets specific standards.

Helps resolve ethical dilemmas.

Provides standards for public accountability.

Introduces new practitioners to ethical practices and promotes self-care and ongoing learning.

Provides standards for assessing unethical conduct.

It guides ethical decision-making but is not a strict rulebook. Ethical choices should consider the context and may involve balancing conflicting values. Peer review and professional judgment are important.

Ethical decision-making is a process. Social workers should consider all relevant values and standards and act in the spirit and letter of the Code.

Social workers are encouraged to also consult ethical theory, laws, policies, and other codes. Personal values and beliefs must be managed carefully to ensure professional conduct. When facing dilemmas, they should seek consultation from colleagues, committees, or legal counsel.

Sometimes ethical obligations conflict with agency policies or laws. In these cases, social workers should try to resolve conflicts responsibly, in line with the Code. If resolution isn’t possible, they should seek proper advice.

The Code may be adopted by various organizations and institutions. Violations of the Code don’t automatically imply legal liability, but they can be reviewed through peer processes.

A code of ethics can’t guarantee ethical behavior or resolve all disputes. It sets values and standards for guidance and judgment. Ethical behavior depends on individual commitment to ethical practice.

Technology and Ethics
As technology becomes more integrated into social work, social workers must be mindful of challenges related to confidentiality, consent, boundaries, competence, and record keeping. The Code applies to both in-person and technology-assisted services, such as phone, email, video calls, and digital platforms. Social workers must stay current with evolving technology and how ethics apply to its use.

Self-Care
Self-care is essential for ethical and competent practice. Demanding work environments and exposure to trauma require social workers to maintain their own health and integrity. Organizations should support policies and practices that promote self-care.

Ethical Principles

The following ethical principles are based on social work’s core values:

Service
Social workers' main goal is to help people in need and address social issues. They place service above self-interest and are encouraged to volunteer without expecting financial return.

Social Justice
Social workers challenge social injustice, especially issues affecting vulnerable and oppressed groups. They advocate for equal access, participation, and opportunity.

Dignity and Worth of the Person
Social workers respect each person’s dignity and promote responsible self-determination. They balance responsibilities to clients and society ethically.

Importance of Human Relationships
Social workers understand that human relationships are key to change. They engage people as partners and work to strengthen relationships at all levels.

Integrity
Social workers act honestly and responsibly, aligning their behavior with the profession’s values. They also take care of themselves to maintain integrity.

Competence
Social workers practice within their areas of competence and strive to improve professionally. They contribute to the profession’s knowledge base.
